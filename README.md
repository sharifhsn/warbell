# ⚔️ Warbell

**Defend the keep against nightly ork sieges.**

A knight holds a central castle through wave after wave of night assaults across a
five-biome island — real-time combat, an economy and upgrade tree, a town you build and
defend, inventory and consumables, villagers, wildlife, and a bloodline succession loop.
Built in Rust on [**Bevy 0.19**](https://bevyengine.org).

## Switch development

The Switch build uses the owned Bevy and wgpu forks at `vendor/bevy` and
`vendor/wgpu`. Bootstrap those checkouts, then bootstrap the devkitPro toolchain
with the external Switch harness before building and sending the NRO:

```sh
tools/bootstrap-switch-deps.sh
../switch/experiments/switch1-deko3d-wgpu/tools/bootstrap-devkitpro-switch.sh
SWITCH_APP=probe tools/build-switch-nro.sh
tools/run-switch-hardware-test.sh probe <switch-ip>
```

The build packages `assets/` at `romfs:/assets`, disables desktop audio and
windowing, and uses the Horizon runner and Deko3D surface path.

The final compiler acceptance is two physical runs. First run the probe above and
visually confirm its frame, setting `SWITCH_VISUAL_RESULT=passed` when recorded. Return
to hbmenu NetLoader, then run the provider-free WGSL compute/readback test:

```sh
DEVKITPRO=/tmp/devkitpro-switch1/opt/devkitpro \
  WGPU_DEKO3D_DIR="$PWD/vendor/wgpu" \
  ../switch/experiments/switch1-deko3d-wgpu/tools/build-wgpu-public-runtime-compute.sh
tools/run-switch-hardware-test.sh compute <switch-ip>
```

Each run writes a revisioned manifest and complete nxlink log under
`target/switch-nro/hardware-acceptance/`. Emulator output does not satisfy this gate.

See [the Switch port handoff](docs/switch-port-handoff.md) for the current
milestone, repository ownership, hardware acceptance gate, and roadmap.
See [the Switch workspace](docs/switch-workspace.md) for the repository layout
and the Codex project root.

## Play

- **Windows:** download [**`Warbell-Setup.msi`**](https://github.com/miskibin/warbell/releases/latest/download/Warbell-Setup.msi) and run it. The installer is self-signed, so Windows SmartScreen shows "Unknown Publisher" — click **More info → Run anyway**.
- **itch.io:** [**miskibin.itch.io/warbell**](https://miskibin.itch.io/warbell) — Windows & Linux builds, pushed automatically on every release (works with the [itch.io app](https://itch.io/app) for auto-updates).
- **From source** (any platform): see [Build from source](#build-from-source) below.

## Controls

- **WASD / arrows** move · **Space** jump · **Shift** sprint · **LMB** attack · **RMB** block
- **V** / the HUD **FP** button — toggle first-person view
- **E** contextual interact — walk up to the keep (upgrades), a merchant stall (shop), the
  war bell (ring in the night), or a chest (open it) and a prompt names it
- **B** build mode — at your town, press **B**, then point and click to raise houses, farms,
  woodcutters and mines
- **Tab / I** satchel · **Q** eat food · **Y / T** quick-slots · **Z / X / C** combat arts
- **F** forage / rescue · **R** recruit · **` (backquote)** free-roam fly-cam · **P / Esc** pause
- **F1** debug tuning panel · **F2** perf/state overlay · **1–5** swap biome patch

## Build from source

```bash
cargo run        # build + open the game window
cargo test       # run the crates/core parity tests (the validation spec)
cargo check      # type-check without the (slow) link
```

On a fresh Linux box you need Bevy's system libraries once before the first build:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
  libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev libudev-dev libasound2-dev
```

(macOS / Windows need none of this.) The first build is slow — `bevy` compiles at
`opt-level = 3` even in dev so the scene isn't single-digit FPS — but incremental rebuilds of
`src/` are fast.

## Architecture

Two crates:

- **`crates/core` (`tileworld_core`)** — pure, deterministic, zero-dependency game logic
  (`f64` throughout). Pathfinding (A*), the wave director, upgrade / buff / resource /
  inventory stores, ork & animal config, factions, RNG, the shop catalog. This is the
  unit-tested validation spec — `cargo test` runs it. No Bevy, no I/O, no rendering.
- **`tileworld_bevy_forest` (root `src/`)** — the Bevy app: rendering, ECS systems, input, the
  scene. It imports `tileworld_core` for all the numbers/logic that must stay correct, wrapping
  core's stores as Resources (`PlayerRes`, `Bank`, `Inventory`, …).

Each `src/<feature>.rs` is a self-contained `Plugin`; **`main.rs` is the assembly list** — read
it as the table of contents. The whole world-sim is gated behind a freeze-gate state machine
(`game_state.rs`): opening any panel or leaving `Playing` freezes the sim but keeps rendering.

See **[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)** for the full conventions (coordinate frame, despawn-race rules,
mesh-building contract, combat-number parity) and **`docs/superpowers/specs/`** for the
per-subsystem roadmap and design docs.

## Screenshot harness

The Bevy window can't be captured externally, so visuals are verified via a render-and-exit
harness:

```bash
# PowerShell
$env:FOREST_SHOT="shot.png"; cargo run
# bash
FOREST_SHOT=shot.png cargo run
```

It renders ~90 frames so lighting/IBL settle, saves the PNG, and exits. Stage the shot with
env vars read at startup: `FOREST_CAM` / `FOREST_TIME` (camera pose / time-of-day),
`FOREST_BIOME` (boot into a biome), `FOREST_WAVE` / `FOREST_DEFEND=1` (stage a night siege),
`FOREST_MENU=1` (start screen), `FOREST_PANEL=tree|inv|build` (open a UI panel),
`FOREST_FP=1` (first-person), `FOREST_EQUIP="sword_gold,gold_armor"` (equip items on the hero).
`BEVY_ASSET_ROOT` points at this dir if you run the binary from elsewhere.
