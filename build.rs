//! Build script — Windows only.
//!
//! Embeds `branding/warbell.ico` and version metadata into the compiled `.exe`'s resource
//! section. Effects from this embed:
//!   * Explorer (the .exe FILE icon) and Alt-Tab show the Warbell bell instead of the generic Rust
//!     exe icon.
//!   * The "Details" tab of the file's Properties shows ProductName / Company / version,
//!     and the installer's Add/Remove-Programs entry inherits them.
//!
//! NOTE: this does NOT brand the *running window* (taskbar / title-bar) — winit registers its window
//! class with `hIcon = 0` and never reads the exe's icon resource for the window. That icon is set
//! at runtime in `src/window_icon.rs`.
//!
//! On non-Windows targets (the Linux release build) this is a no-op.
