//! Biome framework — the data contract every biome plugs into, plus the runner that
//! turns one [`BiomeConfig`] into a live 32×32 grid scene (ground, scatter, backdrop,
//! particles, set-piece landmarks).
//!
//! Five biomes share ONE pipeline; pressing keys **1–5** swaps the active biome at
//! runtime by despawning everything tagged [`BiomeEntity`] and rebuilding from the new
//! config. The camera, sun and IBL persist across the switch — only atmosphere *values*
//! (fog/ambient/sun colour) are re-applied.
//!
//! ## How a biome is authored
//! Each biome lives in its own `biome_<name>.rs` module exposing exactly two fns:
//!   * `pub fn config() -> BiomeConfig` — declarative: ground colour + detail, atmosphere,
//!     a weighted list of scatter [`PropClass`]es, ground-cover classes, river/ocean
//!     flags, the [`Backdrop`] theme and a [`ParticleKind`].
//!   * `pub fn landmarks(commands, meshes, materials)` — optional bespoke set-pieces
//!     (ruins, oasis, frozen pond…). May be a no-op.
//!
//! The grid is the law: scatter rolls **once per tile** over `[-HALF, HALF]` (tiles ==
//! world units), exactly like the TS game, so densities read as "per-tile chance".
