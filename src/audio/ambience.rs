//! leave. Non-spatial (global), so it plays at constant volume regardless of camera angle.
//! "Inside a biome" = the active single-biome view, or — on the combined world map — the
//! biome of the tile under the camera. Both loops play continuously at volume 0; we only ride
//! their volumes, so crossing a region edge crossfades smoothly with no start/stop pops.
//!
//! The campfire loop is the one SPATIAL ambience: each camp's flame entity gets a looping sink
//! attached as a child, so it gets louder as you fly toward the fire.
