//! Ork voices — **trigger only**. This module DETECTS ork-speech opportunities and emits
//! [`super::Speak`] requests; the catalog (`lines.rs`) owns the line data + pitch config, and the
//! director (`director.rs`) owns playback + subtitle. The old bespoke `OrkVoiceBank` /
//! `setup_ork_voice` / `ork_voices` driver has been replaced by the catalog path (Task C4).
//!
//! Architecture:
//! - [`OrkTrigger`] is the one global throttle (replaces `OrkVoiceState`).
//! - [`detect_ork_voices`] fires `Speak::at(OrkSpot/OrkDeath, pos)`.
//! - Pitch-shift per utterance is now DATA on `SpeakerVoice::pitch` for `Speaker::Ork` (0.82–1.18)
//!   applied by the director's `play_line` path — no explicit `speed` param needed here.
//! - The old `ORK_LINE_GUARD` / `OthersSpeaking` stamp is gone: the director tracks the ork's
//!   active line via `VoiceManager.active` and the hero defers via `mgr.others_speaking` already.
