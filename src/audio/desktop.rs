//! Game audio — **event-driven**. Gameplay systems emit [`AudioCue`]s (and set [`MusicState`]);
//! this module owns every audio sink. Ported from the old web game's `audio.ts` / `sfx.ts`
//! central registry, split into focused submodules so each file does one job:
//!
//! - [`sfx`] — one-shot combat/UI/footstep stings + spatial creature voices
//! - [`voice`] — the hero's "one-mouth" voice (swing grunt / hurt / death / biome line)
//! - [`music`] — background bed + a combat layer that swells while orks fight the hero
//! - [`ambience`] — biome / water loops + a spatial campfire loop at each camp
//! - [`footsteps`] — per-step stings tied to the hero's gait + ground surface
//! - [`animals`] — the proximity-gated spatial wildlife calls (this game's own clips)
//!
//! Decoupling rule: gameplay code NEVER spawns a sink — it writes an [`AudioCue`] (or flips a
//! flag on [`MusicState`]). Only this module reads them and plays sound.
