//! Villager / townsfolk voice TRIGGERS — detects situations and emits [`super::director::Speak`]
//! events. The catalog (lines, text, clip IDs, replay floors) now lives in `audio/lines.rs`; the
//! director (`audio/director.rs`) owns playback, subtitle, and the one-mouth-per-speaker gate.
//! This module only decides WHEN a villager should speak, not WHAT or HOW.
//!
//! Behavioral note: the director enforces strictly one villager voice globally at a time (barge-in
//! by priority). The old model allowed one voice per cluster (no two villagers within
//! `CLOSE_SPEAKER_DIST` simultaneously). This is an accepted simplification — the director is
//! the single source of truth now.
