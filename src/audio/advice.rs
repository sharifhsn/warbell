//! **Guidance voice triggers** — the tutorial-in-character layer. New players don't know *why* they
//! need a farm / woodcutter / mine / houses, or what's currently wrong (starving? broke? walls
//! down?). This watches the live town/economy state and, sparingly, asks for ONE guidance line —
//! pooled per concept across the hero (a musing) and the townsfolk (a gripe), so the same nudge
//! sometimes comes from the knight and sometimes from a peasant (see `lines.rs`).
//!
//! Kept deliberately quiet (the explicit design goal — "don't make the game noisy"):
//!   - **Prep-only** — never mid-siege; advice is for the daytime breather.
//!   - **One global throttle** ([`ADVICE_GAP`]) so at most one nudge every ~75 s, *plus* the
//!     per-line replay floors in the catalog (240–600 s) so the same advice can't repeat soon.
//!   - **One-mouth courtesy** — never speaks over the hero or a villager already talking.
//!   - **Priority order** — emits only the single most-urgent condition that holds; if its pooled
//!     lines are all on cooldown the director just stays silent that cycle.
//!
//! Nothing here is saved — it's all recomputed from live resources (like `hints.rs` / `Toasts`).
