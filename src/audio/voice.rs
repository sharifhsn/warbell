//! The hero's voice — head-locked, ONE MOUTH at a time. Ported from the old game's narration
//! node + `canGrunt` gate: a new line / death cry stops whatever the hero was saying, exertion
//! grunts are rate-limited and never fire while a spoken line is playing.
//!
//! Enforcing "one mouth" without juggling possibly-dead entity ids: every voice sink carries
//! [`HeroVoiceTag`], and starting a new one first despawns all tagged sinks. The query only
//! yields LIVE entities, so a clip that already finished (and self-despawned via
//! `PlaybackMode::Despawn`) is simply absent — no stale-entity despawn.
//!
//! Catalog hero lines (event reactions + biome musings) now play via the director as
//! `VoiceSink(Speaker::Hero)`. This module handles ONLY the reflexes: swing grunts, jump grunts,
//! hurt grunts, and the death cry. The two mouths are coordinated:
//! - Grunts defer while a catalog hero line is sounding (`VoiceManager::hero_speaking`).
//! - The death cry despawns any live catalog hero sink so the scream cuts a musing.
