//! **Stone miners work real boulders — the town's NPC stone income (the wood mirror is
//! `lumberjack.rs`).** The Stone Miner plot (`BuildKind::Mine`) has no passive trickle; its
//! worker walks out to an actual ore boulder, picks it apart (the boulder regrows later — see
//! `verbs::deplete_ore` / `regrow_ore`), loads a stone CART, hauls it back to the yard, and only
//! THERE is the stone banked. Lose the miner on the road and you lose the load.
//!
//! It is a near-exact mirror of the woodcutter, with two deliberate divergences:
//!   * **Ranges far** — ore lives in the Rocky biome blob (east), well outside the woodcutter's
//!     safe ring, so there is NO `WORK_R` cap; the miner takes long, riskier trips.
//!   * **Carries a cart** — a small loaded stone wagon trails the miner home ([`Carting`]) in
//!     place of the woodcutter's shouldered log.
//!
//! The flee/blacklist machinery is shared with the woodcutter: a hostile inside [`DANGER_R`]
//! sends the miner running home (`lumberjack::Fleeing` + `flee_steer`) and blacklists the spot in
//! the shared `lumberjack::DangerSpots`. Self-defence is the shared `villagers::FightBack`.
