//! **Villagers** — the castle town's population, ported from the TS `Villager.tsx` mesh tree.
//! Box-mesh humanoids that idle and stroll around the courtyard, with a few posted at the keep +
//! spilling out through the gates. The town pool ([`Townsfolk`]) is a full combat participant
//! now: every member carries [`NpcHp`], guards hunt orks *and* predators near their post, passive
//! workers fight back when struck ([`FightBack`]), and death is permanent (replacements are grown
//! from the food surplus by day — see `town.rs`).
//!
//! Same ambient-biped pattern as `orks.rs`: a static **torso** plus articulated **parts**
//! (2 legs, 2 arms, a head) that swing via the shared sin trick; navigation is the shared
//! local steering (`steer.rs`). Meshes are merged, flat-shaded and vertex-coloured against one
//! white material so the whole town batches into few draw calls.
//!
//! Variants: peasants (varied skin/tunic, some in the conical hat) + a couple of armoured
//! guards (helmet + sword) by the keep. Placed inside `worldmap::build` after the castle, so
//! the castle's wall/keep/house blockers are already registered and townsfolk route around them.
