//! **Siege** — the night-assault wave system, ported from the TS game's
//! `waveStore.ts` / `waveLogic.ts` / `WaveDirector.tsx` / `difficultyStore.ts`.
//!
//! The run is a loop of phases: **prep** (a free-roam "day" — the sun sweeps the sky as a
//! countdown) → **wave** (night falls and a warband marches on the keep from a ring around
//! it) → back to prep on a clear, or **victory** after the boss / **defeat** if the keep is
//! razed. Eight escalating waves, the last a lone giant boss; an `easy/normal/hard` preset
//! scales head-count, ork HP and the length of the day.
//!
//! This module owns the **pure decision core** (the wave table, difficulty presets, the
//! per-frame [`step_wave_director`] reducer and the [`spawn_point`] ring math) — no ECS, no
//! `Time`, no world writes — so wave progression is unit-tested in isolation, exactly like
//! the TS `waveLogic.ts`. The Bevy systems that feed it state and apply its actions live
//! lower in the file.
