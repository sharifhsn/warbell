//! **Orks** — the camp warbands. Box-mesh humanoids ported 1:1 from the TS `Ork.tsx` mesh
//! tree, plus a full combat AI: each ork is home-anchored to its camp and runs an
//! Idle / Patrol / Hunt / Attack state machine — idling within the camp until the hero (or a
//! rival-faction ork) comes into range, then hunting via A* (`navgrid`) and striking. Berserkers
//! frenzy under 40% HP. (The night sieges marching on the keep are a separate brain in
//! `siege.rs`; this module owns the camp warbands.)
//!
//! Like `critters`, an ork is a small entity hierarchy: a static **torso** (legs become
//! articulated) plus articulated **parts** — 2 legs, 2 arms (the right arm carries a baked
//! club, or a staff + orb for the shaman) and a head. The limbs swing procedurally (the
//! `wind.rs` / `animal_limbs` sin trick). Meshes are merged, flat-shaded and vertex-coloured
//! against one shared white material, so a whole warband batches into few draw calls.
//!
//! Variants (grunt / scout / berserker / shaman) differ in skin, scale and weapon; the camp's
//! **faction** (red / blue) tints the loincloth + war-paint so rival camps read apart. All 8
//! variant×faction meshes are built once into an [`Armory`] and clone-spawned per camp.
