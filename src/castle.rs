//! The central **castle** — a faithful, textured Bevy port of the TS game's fully-upgraded
//! city (`cityModels.tsx` + `House.tsx` + `WarBell.tsx`, layout from `cityPlan.ts`). Built
//! complete: keep, perimeter walls split around four gates, four corner towers, eight
//! houses, a cobbled courtyard, the war bell, banners, torches and chimney smoke.
//!
//! This module owns the **meshes** — the structures are otherwise static here; the gameplay that
//! lives *on* them is wired elsewhere: the keep's HP/repair and the night siege in `siege.rs`, the
//! war-bell ring + War Table in `interaction.rs`, the tower-mounted archers/ballista in
//! `defenses.rs`. At the island centre (world origin, flat grass safe-zone, y=0). Kept at TS
//! *absolute* size (NOT ×1.4) but the PERIMETER is widened (`HALF_X/HALF_Z`) for more courtyard
//! room. Coordinate map: world = `(base − (72,54))`.
//!
//! Surfaces use procedural canvas-style textures ported from the TS `textures.ts`
//! (ashlar stone, plaster, wood planks, roof shingles, cobbles, tilled soil) on tiling
//! repeat-sampled materials — the "feels textured like the original" the brief asked for.
//! Solid bits (banners, bronze, crops) + emissive bits (windows, torch flames, gold) use
//! plain materials. Walls + building footprints register in [`crate::blockers`] so the
//! ambient animals route around them.
