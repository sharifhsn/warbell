//! Brands the *running window* (title-bar + Windows taskbar + Alt-Tab) with the Warbell icon.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS — `build.rs` embeds `branding/warbell.ico` into the `.exe` resource section,
//! which brands the **file** icon (Explorer / installer / Add-Remove-Programs). But that is NOT the
//! live window's icon: winit 0.30 registers its window class with `hIcon = 0` / `hIconSm = 0`
//! (verified in `winit-0.30.13/src/platform_impl/windows/{event_loop,window}.rs`), so it never
//! adopts the exe's embedded icon for the window. Result without this module: the taskbar entry of
//! the *running* game showed the generic default icon even though the exe file was branded. (An
//! earlier `build.rs` comment claiming "winit picks up the exe's icon" for the window was wrong.)
//!
//! Fix: decode the branding PNG (compiled into the binary via `include_bytes!`, so there is no
//! runtime file dependency) into RGBA at startup and hand it to winit. The OS rescales the single
//! 256² source for the title-bar / taskbar / Alt-Tab sizes. Cross-platform: correct on Windows +
//! Linux; on macOS `set_window_icon` is a documented no-op (the dock uses the app bundle icon).
