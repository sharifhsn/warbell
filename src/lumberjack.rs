//! **Woodcutters work the woods for real — and the woods are the town's ONLY wood income.**
//! The Lumber plot has no passive trickle (core `BuildKind::produces` → `None` for Lumber);
//! instead its worker walks out to an actual scattered tree, chops it down (the tree topples
//! and regrows later), shoulders the log ([`Hauling`]), carries it back to the yard, and only
//! THERE the wood is banked. Lose the woodcutter on the road and you lose the log.
//!
//! Two hard rails keep this from feeding the orks an endless villager buffet:
//!   * **Safe ground only** — a tree is workable only inside [`WORK_R`] of the castle and at
//!     least [`LIVE_CAMP_AVOID`] from every *occupied* ork camp (and never inside a camp
//!     clearing), so a woodcutter never wanders into a standing warband on its own. A camp whose
//!     warband you've wiped stops pushing the cutter away — its grove opens up for cutting.
//!   * **Threat sense** — any ork or predator inside [`DANGER_R`] sends the woodcutter (working
//!     or hauling) running home ([`Fleeing`]) and blacklists that ground for [`DANGER_TTL`]
//!     seconds ([`DangerSpots`]), so it does NOT trudge straight back under the same shaman's
//!     bolt.
//!
//! While a woodcutter is actually at a tree it counts as `at_post` (the plot reads as staffed
//! in the build UI). If it's caught anyway, the shared villager self-defence
//! (`villagers::FightBack`) takes over — it drops the flight and fights, then resumes the haul.
