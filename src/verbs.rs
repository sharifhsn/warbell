//! **Biome verbs** — acting on the world to feed the bag + stone bank. This module owns the
//! [`HeroSwing`] broadcast (combat publishes one cone per swing-hit; mining reads it) and the
//! ore-mining loop. Foraging and hunt drops land alongside it (chests moved to `chest.rs`).
//!
//! Placement is forest-coord native: [`populate_ore`] (called from `worldmap::build`)
//! reject-samples the rock biome and constructs the test-gated `ore_store::Ore` directly,
//! bypassing core's `OreField::create` (which would snap to core's *own* enlarged tilemap).
