//! The **world map** — a Bevy port of the TS game's island (`src/world/tileMap.ts`),
//! generated in the original BASE space (144×108): an elliptical island with a noisy
//! coast, five biome blobs (snow NW, desert NE, rock E, forest SW, swamp S), a grass
//! centre safe-zone (the castle spot), a grass frontier with scattered forest clumps and
//! rolling terraced knolls, a beach ring backed by patchy coastal mountain ridges, three
//! meandering rivers (each springing from a highland and draining to the sea, their banks
//! projected onto the smooth channel edge — no tile-grid stairstep) + one lake, and **terraced**
//! stepped heights (flat tile-tops + cliff
//! faces; snow peak 10, rock peak 9). South of the old coast the grid extends into the
//! **Blight** — the walkable ork-fortress mire (`TB::Blight`, shape owned by
//! `ork_fortress.rs`) that gameplay treats as swamp (poison + slow).
//!
//! `build` seeds the full playable island: the ground mesh plus ork-camp / castle / ore / chest
//! placement and wildlife (single-biome views, keys 1–5, have no island layout, so none of these).
//! Biome boundaries get **smooth colour blending** (the ground mesh's per-vertex colour is
//! a soft distance-weighted mix of the biome palettes), while the discrete classification
//! still drives heights + which biome's props scatter on each tile.
