//! **Construction feedback** — every freshly raised structure pops out of the ground on a kick
//! of mortar dust, instead of blinking into existence. Two spawn paths feed it:
//!
//!   * town producer buildings (`town::spawn_building`) get a uniform scale-in **pop** on their
//!     ground-anchored parent;
//!   * castle / decor parts (`castle::sync_castle`, `castle_decor::sync_decor`) are baked in
//!     world space on identity transforms, so they get a y-only **rise** out of the ground
//!     (uniform scaling would slide them toward the world origin).
//!
//! Dust reuses the footstep-fx puff assets ([`footstep_fx`](crate::footstep_fx)) — request one by
//! spawning a bare [`DustBurst`] from any system with `Commands`; no plumbing needed.
//!
//! Like the footstep fades, everything here is visual-only and runs **ungated**, so a panel
//! opened mid-pop still lets the structure settle instead of freezing it half-grown.
