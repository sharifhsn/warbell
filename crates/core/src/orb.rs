//! Port of src/world/orbStore.ts — reward orbs (the gold/XP motes that burst off
//! a slain creature, hang for a beat, then accelerate into the hero).
//!
//! The accelerating "suck" (not a constant glide) is what makes collection feel
//! satisfying; deferring the actual gold/XP grant to the moment an orb lands
//! makes the HUD counter race up as they stream in. A hard life cap force-collects
//! any straggler so a reward is never lost to a stuck orb.
//!
//! Pure-side this module owns ONLY the per-orb integration + value splitting. The
//! TS module read the live player position and called addGold/addXp on contact;
//! here the player pose is passed into `step_orb` and contact/cap is reported back
//! via `OrbStep` for the ECS layer to grant. Randomness in the burst is injected
//! (an `f64` source in [0,1)) so the math stays deterministic + testable.
