//! Port of src/world/blockStore.ts — shield-block stamina + frontal mitigation.
//!
//! Hold right-mouse to raise the shield: frontal hits are largely negated, but a
//! stamina bar drains while held and on each blocked hit; empty → the shield is
//! forced down and locked until stamina recovers to a threshold. This stops the
//! player from turtling permanently.
//!
//! The TS store keeps `wantBlock`/`blocking`/`stamina`/`locked`/`regenPause` and
//! advances them in Character.tsx's `useFrame`; `damagePlayer()` calls
//! `absorbBlockedHit()` on a blocked frontal hit. Here the same state lives in
//! `BlockState` with a pure `tick` (advance per dt) + `try_block` (resolve one
//! incoming hit). The ECS layer (`crates/game`) owns the RMB input + wiring the
//! resolved reduction into each `damagePlayer` site.
