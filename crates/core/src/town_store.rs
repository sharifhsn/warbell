//! The town/settlement model — pure, tested, zero-dep. Drives the Bevy `town.rs`
//! city-building layer.
//!
//! **Population is a flow, not a stock.** Every peasant eats; every staffed Farm feeds.
//! The *net* food rate (production − upkeep) accumulates in a signed [`Town::growth`]
//! meter: cross +[`SETTLE_FOOD`] with a free house slot and a peasant **settles** in;
//! cross −[`SETTLE_FOOD`] and one **starves** away. Food is therefore never banked: it is
//! a daily balance you keep positive, not a hoard. Houses (protected, inside the walls)
//! set the population cap; producers (Farm, Woodcutter — exposed on the outer plots) can
//! burn at night.
//!
//! **The castle larder** anchors the whole flow at a bedrock pair: the first
//! [`LARDER_POP`] peasants eat from the castle's own stores (no upkeep — they can never
//! starve away), and while the town is below that pair the larder's surplus
//! ([`LARDER_REGROW_RATE`]) draws settlers back in. So the starting town of
//! [`START_POP`] = 2 isn't a magic number — it's the population the default housing
//! (one founding house) and default food (the larder) actually support, and a town wiped
//! out overnight regrows to the pair within a couple of minutes of dawn. Everyone
//! *beyond* the pair must be housed by built Houses and fed by staffed Farms.
//!
//! Numbers are tuned for forest's building HP pools (see [`BuildKind::max_hp`]) and the day/night siege cadence;
//! tweak the constants below (also exposed to the F1 debug panel).
