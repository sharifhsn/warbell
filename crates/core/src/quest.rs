//! **Tutorial quest chain** — the linear onboarding objectives that teach the core day loop
//! (gather → build → feed → hunt → upgrade → survive). Pure + tested; the Bevy `src/quest.rs`
//! layer feeds it engine [`Signal`]s and renders the tracker / explain card.
//!
//! Content is a static [`QUESTS`] table; the per-run state is the tiny serde-able [`QuestLog`]
//! (one index + one progress float), which rides the save. Objectives are **abstract** — core
//! knows nothing of Bevy `Modal`/`Town`; the src layer maps engine events onto [`Signal`]s and
//! reports them. A signal that doesn't match the active objective is simply ignored, so the
//! Bevy layer is free to fire signals liberally without bookkeeping.

/// One objective a quest can carry. The numeric variants hold their goal; the rest are binary
/// (done in one event).
