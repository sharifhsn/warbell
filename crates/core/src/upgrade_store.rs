//! Port of src/world/upgradeStore.ts — the click-driven upgrade tree.
//!
//! In the TS game each node owns an `apply()` closure that reaches into the
//! player/city/shop/castle/tower/weapon-unlock stores directly. Those cross-store
//! side effects are render/ECS concerns, so per the parity brief they are NOT run
//! here: instead every node carries a typed [`UpgradeEffect`] describing WHAT it
//! does, and the ECS layer (crate `tileworld_bevy`) enacts it against the live
//! Bevy resources. This keeps the core crate Bevy-free and unit-testable — the
//! catalog (ids, costs incl. stone, prereqs, branch, effect) plus the
//! purchase/affordability/gating rules are the parity surface.
//!
//! Cost scaling: the TS rescales every node's gold cost once at module load
//! (`Math.round(cost * 1.6 / 5) * 5`) so the tree isn't out-bought in a few
//! nights. The base costs below are the *pre-scale* numbers from the TS literal;
//! [`UpgradeNode::cost`] applies the same scale on read, so `cost()`, `can_buy`,
//! and the HUD all see the scaled value consistently (the TS mutated the array;
//! a pure accessor is the dep-free equivalent). Stone costs are NOT scaled (the
//! TS only scaled gold).
