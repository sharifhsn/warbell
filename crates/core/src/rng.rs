//! Shared deterministic RNG (mulberry32).
//!
//! Several FX/combat systems in the game crate each carried a byte-identical copy
//! of this generator (`CombatRng`, `OrbRng`, `SparkRng`). They are unified here so
//! there is one source of truth. The `next` math is copied VERBATIM from those
//! impls so the output is bit-identical to the prior per-crate copies — seeding
//! and the order/number of draws at every call site are unchanged.
//!
//! NOTE: the xorshift RNG in `audio.rs` and the LCG in `player_ctl.rs` are
//! DIFFERENT algorithms and are intentionally NOT represented here.

/// Tiny deterministic RNG (mulberry32) — fast, decent distribution, reproducible.
