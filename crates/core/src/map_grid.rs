//! `MapGrid` — the `pathfinding::Grid` trait wired over the REAL ported map
//! (completes P1.4). The pathfinding port abstracts all world queries behind the
//! `Grid` trait so its own tests inject a hand-drawn grid; this is the production
//! implementation that bridges that trait to the actual tilemap/obstacles/
//! house-blocker modules.
//!
//! Each method forwards to the same chokepoint the TS `isWalkable`/`canStep`
//! consulted:
//!   standable     -> tilemap::standable        (land OR bridge deck)
//!   obstacle_tile -> obstacles::is_obstacle_tile
//!   wall_at       -> house_blockers::house_blocks_at  (continuous-space AABB)
//!   can_step      -> tilemap::can_step          (≤ 1 height-class change)
//!   cols / rows   -> tilemap consts
