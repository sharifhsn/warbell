//! Integration port of src/world/mapReachability.test.ts — the player must be
//! able to walk from the castle out to every biome foot and each mountain summit
//! on the REAL procedural map.
//!
//! Rust runs tests in PARALLEL threads sharing process globals, and the bridge
//! registry is a mutable global. So this is ONE test fn: it does the setup
//! (reset_bridges + register the road bridges) and the flood-fill ONCE, then
//! asserts ALL targets in a loop. Splitting per-target would race the registry.
